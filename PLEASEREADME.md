# Tutorial2.5_Challenge
I ran into a lot of problems regarding Challenge 2.

My code for the "You Win!" was working perfectly fine in the editor, but when I built the game, it never showed up.
I couldn't code the lives properly as the code wasn't reading at all in the unity editor.
The box colliders on the enemies wouldn't show up for some reaosn even though they are on the screen, but the player won't react to them.
I didn't have enough time to do everything as my editor refused to build as I was finishing things up and then Unity completely broke on me.

I'm hoping to see you in office hours after spring break to discuss this as I have no idea what to do moving forward regarding the Unity Program.
